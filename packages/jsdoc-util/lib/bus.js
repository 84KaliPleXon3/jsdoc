/**
 * An event bus that works the same way as a standard Node.js event emitter, with a few key
 * differences:
 *
 * + When you create an event bus, you must specify its name. Consider using your package's name.
 * + Event buses are cached and shared by default. If module A and module B both create an event bus
 * called `foo`, both modules get the same event bus. This behavior makes it easier to share one
 * event bus among all of the modules in your package.
 *
 *     To prevent a new event bus from being cached and shared, set the `opts.ignoreCache` property
 *     to `true` when you create the event bus. (Setting this property to `true` also forces a new
 *     event bus to be created, even if there's a cached event bus with the same name.)
 *
 * @alias module:@jsdoc/util.EventBus
 * @extends module:events.EventEmitter
